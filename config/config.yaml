# Oahu Dive Conditions Configuration
# Thresholds, schedules, and delivery preferences

# Scoring thresholds
# NOTE: These values must match the constants in src/core/scorer.py.
# The scorer uses hardcoded constants for performance. Update both places.
scoring:
  # Wave Power Index thresholds (height² × period)
  wpi_thresholds:
    excellent: 5     # WPI <= 5 is excellent (score 100)
    poor: 50         # WPI >= 50 is poor (score 0), linear interpolation between

  # Wind speed thresholds (mph)
  wind_thresholds:
    calm: 5          # 0-5 mph is calm (score 100)
    moderate: 15     # ~15 mph is moderate (score ~50)
    strong: 25       # 25+ mph is strong (score 20, minimum)

  # Stream discharge thresholds for visibility impact (cfs)
  discharge_thresholds:
    low: 5           # <= 5 cfs is clear (score 100)
    high: 50         # >= 50 cfs is high runoff (score 0), linear interpolation between

  # Score weights (must sum to 1.0)
  weights:
    wave_power: 0.35
    wind: 0.25
    visibility: 0.20
    tide: 0.10

  grades:
    A: 85
    B: 70
    C: 55

# Safety gates - conditions that result in automatic "unsafe" rating
safety:
  # Absolute wave height limit regardless of site threshold (ft)
  absolute_max_wave_height: 8.0

  # Default site max if not specified (ft)
  default_max_safe_wave_height: 6.0

  # Gates that trigger unsafe rating
  # NOTE: High Surf Warning is intentionally NOT a safety gate - it's island-wide
  # and may not apply to all coasts. Sites are evaluated by actual local wave height.
  gates:
    - brown_water_advisory
    - wave_height_exceeded
